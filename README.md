⚙️ Adjusted Print Settings

To achieve optimal durability and print quality for the joint, the following custom settings were applied:

| Setting             | Value                      | Reason                                                   |
|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Support             | Enabled                    | To ensure proper printing of overhangs and internal gaps |
| Object Orientation  | 90° rotation               | To optimize stability and strength during printing       |
| Infill Density      | 60%                        | To maximize the strength of the joint                    |
| Wall Loops          | 5                          | Extra perimeter walls to improve mechanical strength     |
| Layer Heigh         | 0.2 mm                     | Balanced resolution and print speed                      |

🧱 Material Used

Material:PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol)

Why PETG?

- Stronger than PLA, less brittle
- Moderate flexibility suitable for moving joints
- Higher heat resistance
- Water and moisture resistant
- Prints reliably with minimal warping

---

📌 Notes

- The joint has **5 base holes (5mm diameter)** for secure mounting.
- There are **2 side holes** for connecting actuators or additional arm parts.
- Ensure bed adhesion (use Brim if needed) for stable printing.

🔄 Suggested Improvements

- Post-process with light sanding if hole tolerances are tight
- Use threaded inserts for long-term durability of screw holes
